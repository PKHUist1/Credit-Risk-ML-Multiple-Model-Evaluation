# Credit-Risk-ML-Multiple-Model-Evaluation
## Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning for credit risk modelling
using a synthetically generated dataset designed to align with real world credit application data.

Multiple classification models were evaluated across the full machine learning
lifecycle. Model evaluation was multi-faceted, with assesment not just examining evaluation metrics but also how applicable each model would be in the context of real world credit risk modelling.  
## Business Context
In credit risk scenarios, machine learning models are typically used as
decision-support tools rather than fully automated approval systems. As a
result, model interpretability and stability are critical considerations
alongside predictive performance.

This project focuses on:

Evaluating models using metrics suitable for imbalanced classification

Understanding which features drive predictions

Assessing model behaviour under realistic assumptions
